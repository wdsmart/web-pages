<p>
	We release as much of the software developed in our research group as possible under an open-source license.  Most of our robotics-related software is written in the <a target="_blank" href="http://ros.org">Robot Operating System (ROS)</a> framework.  All of our publicly-available code is hosted on <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/">github</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/OSUrobotics">http://github.com/OSUrobotics</a>

	Some older software, from my time at Washington University in St. Louis, is available from our old <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net">sourceforge</a> site at <a target="_blank" href="http://wu-ros-pkg.sourceforge.net">http://wu-ros-pkg.sourceforge.net</a>.
